# Uh... hi
<img src="Fox.png" width=175 align=left>

Not every day I get to see a new face around here <br>
... Or any faces at all I guess <br>
I'd ask you to take a seat.. if I had one <br>
But we're already drifting apart now <br>
Well.. it was nice to see ya..! <br>
<sub> Good luck on your travels... </sub>
